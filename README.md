HOW TO GET STARTED
------------------------------------
Use the Devbranch Version: https://github.com/FuckingToasters/discord-phone-verifier/tree/dev</br>
The Dev Branch will be updated regulary and in case you find any Errors you can open an Issue to report them.</br>
If i'm certain that the current version inside the devbranch is errorfree, i'll push it to the mainbranch.

Before opening an Issue, make sure to carefully read and understand the readme file as most things are explained in detail there.</br>
Finally, Good luck with mass verifing Accounts :)


PLEASE NOTE
------------------------------------
You can use the Tool, modify and it and use it for private purposes. You are not Allowed to sell the orginal src or a modified version.</br>
(If u are poor, you should buy EV from someone and make thwm Fully Verified using the tool, then sell the FV ones but don't sell this tool pls)
