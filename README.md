HOW TO GET STARTED
------------------------------------
For Users who don't have balance left on sites like [ONLINESIM](https://onlinesim.io) can use the new version with a lot more Features
The New version only support [VAKSMS](https://vak-sms.com) at the moment (which is a cheaper solution than others anyways)

If you have balance left on [ONLINESIM](https://onlinesim.io) which you want to use first, you need to choose the old version
Onlinesim will be added to the new one later so you benefit from the new features too
